# Time-Series-Predictive-CNN
This is a time series predictive CNN model built using Keras. Currently it takes univariate data as an input and can output multiple time steps

### Set up
To set up, I used a conda environment to create a virtual environment to handle the dependencies.

### Future work
Future work involves introducing a validation step to validate the trained data, and making the model more deeper
